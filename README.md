# BitFrame Hello World Example

This example demonstrates very basic functionality of the [BitFrame PHP Microframework](https://www.bitframephp.com) to output `Hello World!` to the browser.

### Install

#### Prerequisites

* PHP 7.1.0+
* Webserver with URL Rewriting (such as Apache or nginx)

#### Install Via Composer

Simply navigate to the `hello_world` project directory in terminal/command line (to the folder where `composer.json` resides) and run the following command:

```
composer install
```

Make sure you have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) installed.

### Running The Code

Once you've installed the required dependency files, point your browser to the `hello_world` project's url (for example: http://localhost/hello_world/public_html/) to see a page that outputs `Hello World!`. Remember though, since we're not using a Router, all pages would display the same output by default.
